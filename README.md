Interactive Text-Based Adventure Game in Haskell

Haskell Programming Semester 1 Coursework - 1st class grade equivalent achieved for code accuracy & quality

Technologies Used: Haskell, Functional Programming, State Management, Game Logic Design

Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented a text-based adventure game featuring dynamic storytelling and interactive gameplay.
- Created a structured game world using custom data types (Character, Party, Node, Location, Map, and Game).
- Developed a functional event system where game states evolve based on user choices and predefined logic.
- Implemented recursive algorithms and higher-order functions to handle game mechanics such as movement, dialogue selection, and event triggering.
- Ensured immutability and referential transparency while managing complex state transitions efficiently.

Skills Acquired:
- Proficiency in Haskell and functional programming paradigms.
- Experience in designing and handling immutable game states.
- Recursive problem-solving and algorithm design.
- Strong understanding of type systems and data abstraction in functional languages.
